            <h2>What is HTML and CSS?</h2>
            <p>HTML provides the foundation for webpage content, allowing you to add elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, videos, and links. With CSS, you can enhance your webpage by styling and customizing elements, such as adjusting colors, fonts, and layouts.</p>

            <h2>Step 1 - Set up your text editor and HTML file</h2>
            <p>To begin using HTML, you'll need a text editor, which is a software program for writing code. Your first step is to download a free text editor. Notepad++ is a good option for Windows users, while Sublime Text is popular among Mac users. Once you open the text editor, you'll see an editor window where you can write your HTML code.</p>
            <p>Make sure you save this new file with the name index.html on a folder with the name "Your first web page".</p>
            <p>With the text editor open, you're ready to start creating HTML tags. HTML tags are the building blocks of a webpage, used to structure and format content. Remember to save your file with a .html extension to ensure it's recognized as an HTML document. Now, let's get started building your webpage!</p>
